# ColorCoding  - Beta
ColorCoding - Anki Add-on 

Improve your learning strategy with the ColorCoding add-on. ColorCoding lets you set specific font colors for different terms and automatically colors those preset words when adding new cards. Consistent color-coding of your Anki cards will effectively improve memory.

## Installation
Please follow the instruction on the anki web page. 

## How to use ColorCoding

Within anki, open “Tools” -> “Color Coding…”. 

Type

{“word: “color name or code”, …} (e.g.: {"arteries": "red", "veins": "blue”}).

Save.

All available HTML color names and HEX color codes can be used. One color can be set for as many words as you want. Thus, specific font colors can be used for either a single term or an entire group of words. 

Preset words will automatically be colored while typing within the Add window.
